# Data-Modelling-with-Apache-Cassandra

# OBJECTIVE
To create an apache cassandra database based on the queries given by the analytics team of the startup 
'Sparkify' in order to fetch song play data to answer the questions. For that, I first created an ETL 
pipeline to preprocess the data. After that, with the help of the queries, I created three tables in 
order to retrieve information to answer the questions.
